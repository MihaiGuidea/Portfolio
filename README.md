### My portfolio website

Portfolio created based on a template from html5up.net, modified and improved on my preference. 

It includes a short **description** of myself, **projects** I have done, things I am involved in (**log, hobbies, my impact on the community**), and a **contact form**.

The portfolio design is a one-page layout, using HTML, CSS, SCSS and Javascript.
